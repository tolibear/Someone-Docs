# Sending & Receiving Messages

Using a channel that's connected to a Bridge Room is simple! There's no special syntax or commands to learn - just chat normally, and your messages will automatically appear in all connected channels.

## Message Mirroring

When you send a message in a bridged channel:

1. The Someone bot receives your message
2. It creates copies in all other channels in the same Room
3. Each copy appears with your username and avatar
4. Anyone in those other channels can see and interact with your message

## Message Types That Work

Most types of Discord messages work seamlessly across bridges:

- **Text Messages**: Plain text, formatted text, and emojis
- **Attachments**: Images, videos, documents, and other files
- **Embeds**: Rich content from links (if link wrapping is disabled)
- **Reactions**: Both standard and custom emoji reactions
- **Replies**: Replies to messages, including quote content
- **Stickers & GIFs**: Animated content

## Editing & Deleting Messages

Made a typo? Want to remove a message? No problem:

- **Editing**: When you edit a message, the changes appear in all mirrored copies
- **Deleting**: When you delete a message, it's removed from all connected channels

This works both ways - if someone edits or deletes a message in another channel, you'll see those changes too.

## Reacting to Messages

Adding reactions works across all bridged channels:

1. Click the reaction button (üëç) or right-click a message
2. Choose your reaction emoji
3. The reaction appears on all copies of the message in other channels
4. You can see who added each reaction by hovering over it

## Replying to Messages

When replying to a message:

1. Hover over or right-click the message you want to reply to
2. Click the reply button or select "Reply" from the menu
3. Type your response
4. Your reply will be mirrored to all channels, including the reply reference

If you're replying to a message from another channel, the "replying to" preview will show who originally sent it.

## User & Role Mentions

When mentioning users or roles:

- **Same Server**: Mentions work normally for users in the same server
- **Cross-Server**: When mentioning users from other servers, it may appear as plain text depending on the Room's settings
- **Role Mentions**: These may also be converted to plain text in cross-server scenarios

## Webhook Display

You might notice that messages from other channels appear to be sent by webhook users (with "[BOT]" tags). This is normal - it's how the bridge technology works.

To see who actually sent a message, you can use the [Context Commands](/users/context-commands).

## Tips for Bridge Users

- **Be aware of audiences**: Remember that your messages are visible to people in all connected channels
- **Context matters**: If discussing something channel-specific, mention which channel you're talking about
- **Use "Room Info"**: Right-click a message ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Room Info to see which channels are connected
- **Mention correctly**: When mentioning someone, remember they might be in a different server

## Understanding Source Indicators

If enabled by the Room admin, messages may show where they originated from:

- **Same Server**: Shows as `#channel-name`
- **Different Server**: Shows as `ServerName > #channel-name`

These indicators help you keep track of where conversations are coming from.
