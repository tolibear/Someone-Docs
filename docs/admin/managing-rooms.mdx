# Managing Bridge Rooms

Once you've [set up your first Room](/admin/setup), you'll need to know how to manage it effectively. This guide covers how to view Room information, add or remove channels, and delete Rooms entirely.

## Viewing Room Information

To see details about a Room and its connected channels:

1. In any channel that's part of a Room, right-click any message
2. Select **Apps** â†’ **Room Info**
3. A message will appear showing:
   - The Room's unique ID
   - Which channel is the host
   - All channels currently in the Room
   - When the Room was created

Alternatively, you can use the `/settings` command in any bridged channel to see basic Room information.

## Adding More Channels to a Room

To add more channels to an existing Room:

1. Follow the [Adding Channels](/admin/setup#step-3-add-channels-to-your-room) steps from the setup guide
2. There's a limit of 10 channels to a single room.

## Removing a Channel from a Room

If you want to disconnect a channel from a Room:

1. Go to the channel you want to remove
2. Type `/settings`
3. Click the **Leave Room** button
4. Confirm your choice

This will immediately stop message mirroring for this channel while preserving the rest of the Room's connections.

## Transferring Room Ownership

Currently, the host channel cannot be changed after a Room is created. If you need to change the host:

1. Create a new Room from your desired host channel
2. Have all channels leave the old Room and join the new one
3. Delete the old Room (see below)

## Deleting an Entire Room

To completely remove a Room and disconnect all its channels:

1. Go to the **host channel** of the Room
2. Type `/settings`
3. Click the **Leave Room** button
4. You'll see a special warning that you're about to delete the entire Room
5. Confirm by clicking **Delete Room**

**Warning**: This action disconnects all channels and permanently deletes the Room (but not the channel). It cannot be undone.

## Managing Join Requests

As the host channel's admin, you'll receive requests when channels from other servers try to join your Room:

1. Go to your host channel
2. Type `/settings`
3. Click **View Requests**
4. For each pending request:
   - Click **Approve** to add the channel to your Room
   - Click **Deny** to reject the request

Denied requests can be submitted again after a short waiting period.

## Best Practices

- **Host Selection**: Choose a host channel in a server where you have reliable admin access
- **Documentation**: After setting up complex bridge networks, document which channels are connected
- **Permissions**: Regularly verify that the bot still has all needed permissions in connected servers
- **Maintenance**: Periodically check your Rooms to ensure all channels are still active and relevant

## Troubleshooting

If messages aren't being mirrored properly:

1. Verify the bot has **Manage Webhooks** permission in all connected channels
2. Check that the channel is still part of the Room using the Room Info command
3. Make sure the bot hasn't been removed from any of the servers
4. If issues persist, try removing and re-adding the problematic channel to the Room
