Someone provides special commands that you can access by right-clicking on messages in bridged channels. These commands help you get more information about bridged messages and the Rooms they belong to.

## Accessing Context Commands

To use a context command:

1. Right-click (or long-press on mobile) on any message in a bridged channel
2. Look for the **Apps** section in the menu
3. You'll see commands from the Someone bot

## Get Info Command

The **Get Info** command tells you details about the original message, even if you're looking at a mirrored copy.

### What It Shows

- **Original Sender**: The username and ID of the person who actually sent the message
- **Original Channel**: Where the message was first posted
- **Original Timestamp**: When the message was sent
- **Last Edited**: When the message was last edited (if applicable)

### When To Use It

- When you want to know who really sent a message (since bridged messages appear from webhooks)
- When you're unsure if a message is from your channel or a bridged one
- When you need to know exactly when a message was sent

## Room Info Command

The **Room Info** command shows you details about the bridge Room that your channel belongs to.

### What It Shows

- **Room ID**: The unique identifier for this bridge Room
- **Host Channel**: Which channel is the "host" of this Room
- **Connected Channels**: All channels that are part of this Room
- **Creation Date**: When the Room was first created
- **Owner**: Who created the Room

### When To Use It

- When you want to see which other channels can see your messages
- When you need to know who manages the Room (the host channel admins)
- When you're unsure if a channel is bridged or not

## Mobile Usage

On mobile devices:

1. Long-press on any message
2. Tap on the "..." menu
3. Look for the **Apps** section
4. Select the Someone command you want to use

The information appears in a reply message that only you can see.

## Command Availability

These commands are available to all users in bridged channels - no special permissions required. However:

- You need to be in a channel that's part of a Room to see these commands
- The commands only appear on messages in bridged channels
- The bot needs to have permission to respond to application commands

## Using Command Information

The information from these commands can be helpful for:

- **Contacting Users**: If you need to directly contact someone who sent a message from another channel
- **Understanding Context**: Figuring out where a conversation started
- **Troubleshooting**: Verifying that bridges are working correctly
- **Community Awareness**: Knowing which communities you're connected to
