# Admin Setup Guide

Setting up Someone for your server is straightforward. This guide will walk you through the process of inviting the bot and creating your first bridge Room.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Admin or Manage Channels** permission in your Discord server
- A clear idea of which channel you want to bridge
- If bridging across servers, you will need to share your channel link with them (and they need to have Someone installed)

## Step 1: Invite the Bot

1. Click the **[Invite Bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1318408868606251030&scope=bot&permissions=533113195584)** button at the top of this page
2. Select the server you want to add Someone to
3. Review and approve the requested permissions
4. Complete the Discord authorization flow

**Required Permissions:**
- Manage Webhooks (for message mirroring)
- Send Messages (for bot responses)
- Read Message History (for context awareness)
- Use Application Commands (for slash commands)
- Add Reactions (for reaction mirroring)

## Step 2: Create a Room

A "Room" is the core concept in Someone - it's a group of channels that are all connected together.

1. Choose a channel to be your "host" channel (this is the central channel for your Room)
2. In that channel, type `/settings`
3. Click the **Create Room** button in the message that appears
4. You'll see a confirmation that your Room has been created

Congratulations! You've created your first Room with this channel as the host.

## Step 3: Add Channels to Your Room

### Adding Channels From Different Servers

1. First, [invite the bot](#step-1-invite-the-bot) to the other server
2. Go to the channel you want to bridge in that server
3. Type `/settings`
4. Click **Join Room**
5. Paste the channel ID or link of your host channel
6. A join request is sent to the host channel's server

## Step 4: Approve Join Request

If you're the admin of the host channel and receive join requests from other servers:

1. Go to your host channel
2. Type `/settings`
3. Click **View Requests**
4. For each request, click either **Approve** or **Deny**

## Testing Your Bridge

Once your channels are connected:

1. Send a test message in any of the connected channels
2. Verify the message appears in all other channels in the Room
3. Try editing your message to confirm edits are mirrored
4. Add a reaction to see if reactions are mirrored
